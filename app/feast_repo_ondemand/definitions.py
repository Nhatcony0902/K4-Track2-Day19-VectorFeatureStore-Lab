"""On-demand feature transformation: the request-time ratio (NB8).

Deck reference: "On-Demand Feature: Tinh Tai Thoi Diem Request".

The strongest fraud feature is `amount / avg_amount_7d`. It cannot be
materialised: `amount` does not exist until the transaction arrives. An
on-demand feature view joins a STORED feature with REQUEST data and applies one
formula -- the same formula for training and for serving, which is the whole
point of a feature store.
